<p id="format"> Ok guys ! I hope you are all ready, this is the moment we have been dreaming all our lives.
    When our forefathers fought for a higher cause such as freedom.They never thought a day like this would come. Where not only are we fighting for
    a nations freedom but, for the freedom of all intergalactic lives. So now lets get to how are we going to accomplish this. We will look at our top of 
    the line strategy plans. I'm telling you we have the best strategists ,that have played countless hours of age of empire.

    First, the Karens will distract the Guards. They will be separated into two battalions. The first battalion will
    jam the communication line
    between the Area 51 Guards and the US armed and air forces.
    The second group will hide behind the Kyles. The Kyles will be equipped with Monster
    Energy drinks and Axe oil. They should accumulate enough energy in the Area 51 Alien Centre before leaving.
    Once at the perimeters, they will charge through the walls of the Area and make an easy entrance for all the other troops.
    They will also take down the Guards who stand in their way, but for that they need assistance.
    We will start sending in the rock throwers to distract the Guards with rocks and defend the Kyles.
    We should stock up with about 5000 rocks before we head to the Area. Meanwhile, the Karens serve as the second line of distraction, and will try to seduce the Guards with sexy looks. We will then send drones and drone hangers, as well as battle royale gamers to hang on the drones and parachutes respectively. They will land into the base and turn off all defences to provide easier entry. For the penultimate wave, we will send in two armies of gunmen. They will be equipped with Rapid Blast Nerf guns and Air-Soft guns. One of the armies will surround Shane Dawson as he documents all the events that had happened and stream it live. The other army will surround our final trooper. Sans. He will gastroblast all remaining Guards as well as the locked entry to Area 51. Once inside, we will have full access to whatever that is inside, but we must still remain wary for potential Guards. Finally, everyone will meet up at The Central Vault where we suspect the military has kept the top secret experiments and most importantly, aliens. Then, the Minecrafters will dig a tunnel from inside the Area to outside, as the military would have arrived by now. Before and After the Raid. We will all assemble in the Area 51 Alien Centre as well as another makeshift holding area which we will begin building in mid-August. The last draft of the plan will be confirmed 5 days before the raid, so this plan is just a draft. We will start arriving in groups of 10000s every 3 hours apart, starting from August 15. This is so that we can avoid jamming Nevadaâ€™s roads, which will cause massive delay. We will stay in nearby hotels until closer to D-day, when we will travel in groups to the Area 51 Alien Centre.
    There, we will get equipped, rest up to tip-top condition.
    The plan will be announced one more time before we leave to Area 51 at around September 19, 11 pm.
    Then, the first group-Karens will be deployed at September 20, 3 am, each wave lasting around 1 hour.
    We should get into Area 51 by 7 am, see everything we need to see, take everything we need to take, and leave by 9 am.
    We will assemble at the Alien Centre at 12 pm, tally up the losses, getting paramedics on site to care for the wounded,
    send the wounded to the nearest hospital, relax, chill out, have the final debrief and congratulations, and leave by 3 pm,
    in a similar fashion and grouping as how we entered. Everyone should be able to leave by October 1. Note: this was not created by me, heavily inspired by ideas online.
    The only original thing was the before and after part. Map will be coming soon.
